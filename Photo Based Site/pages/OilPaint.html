            <h1>Oil Paint</h1>
            <p>Here are some of my Oil Paintings. I took two semesters of oil painting at MCC and here are some of the pieces I made. The class was very hands-on and I gained valuable experience and knowledge. I learned how to stretch my own canvas too! I would like to frame and maybe sell some of these eventually.
