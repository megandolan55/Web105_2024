<p>Spotify is my favorite platform for music streaming! I also enjoy Youtube and Vevo for music videos.</p>
<p>When it comes to music, I enjoy multiple genres and styles. There are alot of pop artists with catchy songs that are fun to sing to and there are also alot of musicians with more in-depth songs that I enjoy listening to.</p>
