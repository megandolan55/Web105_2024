<p>I enjoy hiking and taking walks and I am excited for the weather to warm up so I can get back out there! Exercise is good for physical as well as mental health. 
    Some trails I've hiked include Moraine Hills State Park in McHenry, Veteran's Acres/Sterne's Woods in Crystal Lake, Peninsula State Park in Door County, WI, and Devil's Lake State Park in WI.
